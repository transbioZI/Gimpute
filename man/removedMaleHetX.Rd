\title{Remove male subjects with haploid heterozygous SNPs}
\usage{
removedMaleHetX(plink, inputPrefix, hhSubjCutOff = 15, outputPrefix,
  outputSubjHetFile, outputRetainSubjectFile, outputHetSNPfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{plink}{an executable program in either the current working directory 
or somewhere in the command path.}

\item{inputPrefix}{the prefix of the input PLINK binary files.}

\item{hhSubjCutOff}{the cutoff for removing male subjects with haploid 
heterozygous SNPs on the chromosome X. The default is 15.}

\item{outputPrefix}{the prefix of the output PLINK binary files.}

\item{outputSubjHetFile}{the output pure text file that stores male subjects 
that have heterozygous SNPs with their frequency (if any), i.e. the number 
of .hh SNPs in this male. Lines are sorted by descending number.}

\item{outputRetainSubjectFile}{the output pure text file that stores
male subjects that have heterozygous SNPs with their frequency after 
subject removal (if any). Lines are sorted by descending number.}

\item{outputHetSNPfile}{the output pure text file that stores all 
heterozygous SNPs with their frequency (the number of males for this SNP)
, if any. Lines are sorted by descending number.}
}
\value{
1.) The output PLINK binary files. 2.) A pure text file with 
two columns: heterozygous male subjects and their corresponding heterozygous
SNPs. 3.) After subject removal, a pure text file consisting of two columns:
heterozygous male subjects and their corresponding heterozygous SNPs. 
A pure text file with two columns: all heterozygous SNPs and their frequency.
}
\description{
Determine the frequency of male subjects that have heterozygous SNPs on 
chromosome X and a reasonable cutoff to remove those affect males, if 
chromosome X data exists.
}
\details{
A haploid heterozygous is a male genotype that is heterozygous, 
which could be an error given the haploid nature of the male X chromosome.
In principle, one has to remove all males that have heterozygous SNPs on the 
chromosome X. However, too many males might be removed in some data sets. 
Therefore a small percentage of such males in the data set is allowed.

\examples{
## In the current working directory
bedFile <- system.file("extdata", "genoUpdatedData.bed", package="Gimpute")
bimFile <- system.file("extdata", "genoUpdatedData.bim", package="Gimpute") 
famFile <- system.file("extdata", "genoUpdatedData.fam", package="Gimpute")
system(paste0("scp ", bedFile, bimFile, famFile, " ."))  
inputPrefix <- "genoUpdatedData" 
hhSubjCutOff <- 15 ##  can be tuned
outputPrefix <- "2_02_removedInstHetX" 
outputSubjHetFile <- "2_02_instHetXfreqAll.txt" 
outputRetainSubjectFile <- "2_02_instHetXfreqRetained.txt"  
outputHetSNPfile <- "2_02_snpHHfreqAll.txt"
## Not run: Requires an executable program PLINK, e.g.
## plink <- "/home/tools/plink"
## removedMaleHetX(plink, inputPrefix, hhSubjCutOff,
##                 outputPrefix, outputSubjHetFile, 
##                 outputRetainSubjectFile, outputHetSNPfile)
